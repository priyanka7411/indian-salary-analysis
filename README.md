## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- **Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)**
- **Statistical Tests (Scipy, Shapiro-Wilk, Kruskal-Wallis, Mann-Whitney U)**
- **Tableau** for final dashboard
- **Jupyter Notebook** for analysis and visualizations

## 🔍 Key Steps

### 1. Data Cleaning
- Removed nulls and duplicates
- Parsed salary strings (₹6,00,000/yr → 600000)
- Created new columns: `job_category`, `salary_in_inr`

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis
- Top job roles and cities in dataset
- Salary distribution by role and city
- Outlier detection and skewness analysis

### 3. Statistical Testing
- ✅ Shapiro-Wilk: Checked for normality
- ✅ Levene’s test: Checked for equal variances
- ✅ Kruskal-Wallis: Salary difference across job roles
- ✅ Mann-Whitney U: Salary comparison between cities (e.g., Bangalore vs Pune)

### 4. Tableau Dashboard
Interactive salary dashboard built with Tableau Public.
